Hi, I'm kaka, from Taiwan. :wave:

I'm a software engineer at [Inventec](https://www.inventec.com/en) focusing primarily on the development of [Advanced Driver Assistance Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver-assistance_systems) and related application with `Python` & `C/C++`. I received M.S.(2015) in `Bio-Industrial Mechatronics Engineering` from [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/).
